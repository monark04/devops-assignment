# DevOps Practical Assignment

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
This assignment will give you **hands-on experience with real-world DevOps tools** â€” Git, GitHub, Docker, and Jenkins â€” by creating a complete CI/CD pipeline for a simple Node.js application.

By the end of this assignment, you will:
- Work with Git branching, commits, and pull requests.
- Containerize a Node.js app using Docker.
- Automate the build and deployment using Jenkins.
- Deploy the app on a server and verify it runs.

---

## ðŸ›  Prerequisites
- Installed: **Git, Docker, Jenkins** (or access to Jenkins server)
- A GitHub account
- A running server/VM (local or AWS EC2) to deploy the app

---

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

```bash
.
â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile
â”œâ”€â”€ Jenkinsfile
â”œâ”€â”€ index.js
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ README.md  # (This file)
```

## ðŸš€ Assignment Steps
1. Fork & Clone
  - Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.
  - Clone it locally:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/veershah-sh/devops-assignment
    cd devops-assignment
    ```
2. Create a Feature Branch
  ```git checkout -b feature/<name>-hello-route```

3. Modify the App
Edit index.js and add a new route:
```javascript
app.get('/hello', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello from <Your Name>!');
});
```

4. Commit & Push
```
git add .
git commit -m "Added /<name> hello route"
git push origin feature/<name>-hello-route
```

5. Create a Pull Request
  - Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
  - Open a Pull Request from feature/<name>-hello-route â†’ main.
  - Merge the Pull Request once approved.

6. Write a Dockerfile
  - Sample Dockerfile
  - Build and run locally

7. Configure Jenkins Pipeline
  1. Open Jenkins UI â†’ Create a new Pipeline job.
  2. Configure Pipeline Script from SCM:
      - SCM: Git
      - Repository URL: https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
      - Branch: main
      - Script Path: Jenkinsfile
      - Sample Jenkinsfile:
    
8. Verify Deployment
  - Access the deployed app
